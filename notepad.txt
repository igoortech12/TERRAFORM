Whats is Terraform?
What is Terraform used for?
Difference between Terraform and Ansible
Terraform Architecture & Commands

WHAT IS TERRAFORM?
    Automate and manage your infrastructure
    Your platform
    And services that run on that platform 
        open source
        declarative (= define WAHT end result you want)
        Imperative = define exact steps - HOW

    Tool for infrastructure provisioning
        What does that mean?
        Prepare infrastructure
            1-Private network
            2-EC2 server instances
            3-Install Docker
            4-Security

        Provisoning infrastructure
            create VPC
            spin up servers
            create AWS users and permissions
            install Docker

DIFFERENCE ANSIBLE AND TERRAFORM?
    Which one to use?
        Both: infrastructure as a Code.
        Both Automate: provisioning, configuring and managing the infrastructure

    Terraform 
        Mainly infrastructure provisioning tool 
        CAN deploy apps

        BETTER: for infrastructure

    Ansible
        Mainly a configuration tool
            - configure that infrastructure
            - deploy apps
            - install/update software
        
        BETTER: for configuring that infrastructure

HOW DOES TERRAFORM WORK?
    How does Terraform connect to the platform provider?

    Terraform Architecture

    Examples configuration Files

    # Configure the AWS Provider
    provider "aws" {
        version = "~> 2.0"
        region = "us-east-1"
    }  

    # Create a VPC
    resource "aws vpc" "example" {
        cidr_block = "10.0.0.0/16" 
    }

    # Configure the Kubernetes Provider
    provider "kubernetes" {
        config_context_auth_info = "ops"
        config_context_cluster = "mycluster"
    }

    resource kubernetes_namespace "example" {
        metadata {
            name = "my-firts-namespace"
        }
    }

    DECLARATIVE vs IMPERATIVE
    What does declarative mean exactly?

    You define the end state in your config file:
        - 5 servers with following network
        - AWS user with following permissions

    Benefits when updating the infrastructure
    IMPERATIVE config file 
        - remove 2 servers
        - add firewakk config 
        - add permissions to AWS user
        
        You give instructions
    
    DECLARATIVE config file 
        - 7 servers
        - this firewall config
        - User with following permissions

        Figure out yourself what needs to be done
        Adjust old config file and re-execute
        Clean and small config file
        Always know the current setup

    TERRAFORM COMMANDS FOR DIFFERENT STAGES
        Refresh: query infrastructure provider to get current state.
        Plan: create an execution plan.
        Apply: execute the plan.
        Destroy: destroy the resources/infrastructure
